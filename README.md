To use these codes, you must have separate data files for each type of measurement, such as ‘ARF’, “ART” and ‘bdf’, in the same folder as the .cpp files.

Each data folder must be named in the format YYMMDD_hhmmss: for example, if data acquisition begins on 24 July 2025 at 12:00, the name of the folder containing the data must be ‘250724_120000’. This way, the UNIX timestamp for the start will be automatically set based on the folder name!
